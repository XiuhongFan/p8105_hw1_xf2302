# Problem 1
# Add initial setup chunk and load required libraries
```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```
# Load the dataset
```{r load_data}
data("early_january_weather")
```
# Preview the initial rows of the dataset
```{r preview_data}
head(early_january_weather)
```
# Check the number of rows
```{r check_rows}
nrow(early_january_weather)
```
# Check the number of columns
```{r check_cols}
ncol(early_january_weather)
```
# Calculate mean temperature without NA values
```{r mean_temp}
mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Within the `early_january_weather` dataset, there are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. Among the most relevant variables are *temperature*, *humidity*, and *time_hour*. The mean recorded temperature is about `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` degrees Fahrenheit.
