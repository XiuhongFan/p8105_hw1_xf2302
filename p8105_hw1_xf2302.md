# Problem 1

# Add initial setup chunk and load required libraries

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Load the dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

# Add dataset summary description using inline R

Within the `early_january_weather` dataset, there are 358 rows and 15
columns. Key variables include *temperature* (measured in °F),
*humidity* (percentage of air moisture), and *time_hour* (timestamp for
each observation). The mean recorded temperature is about 39.58 degrees
Fahrenheit.

# Add scatterplot of temperature vs time_hour colored by humidity

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Describe patterns

The scatterplot of temperature (°F) against time_hour, colored by
humidity, shows that temperature fluctuates between about 30°F and 55°F,
with a mean near 39.6°F. Higher humidity values, indicated by cooler
colors, are generally associated with lower temperatures, while lower
humidity values align with warmer conditions. A clear cyclical pattern
emerges over time, reflecting daily temperature increases during daytime
and decreases at night.
